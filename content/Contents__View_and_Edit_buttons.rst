You can now make changes to the different parts of your webpage. You will see that the Editing interface divides the webpage up into different sections. Tutorials are available on how to edit each section of your page.

Clicking on the Contents button gives you a view of the page structure of the part of the website that you are currently on. For example clicking on Contents in the Research section of the website above shows you a list of all the Research Theme and Research Group pages:

1. You can use this interface to carry out tasks such as deleting, moving, copying and renaming the URL of your content. 
2. You can move around the different pages of the website in the Contents interface by clicking on the page name to move to pages lower down the hierarchy or (3.) using the up arrow to move to pages higher up. 

You will probably not need to use the Contents interface for most of your editing work. If you have any doubts about how this works please ask us.
