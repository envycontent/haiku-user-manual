Style guide
===========

For the most part, we have adopted the `University Style Guide <http://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/media_wysiwyg/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide.pdf>`_ for the new MSD website - except for instances detailed below.  

It is essential that the website content and design remains consistent, and much of the design and layout is fixed. The Communications and Web Team will monitor the site regularly and any changes made that are inconsistent with our chosen style will be changed.

Voice
-----

* Use first person (I, we)
* Do not use abbreviations, or spell them out the first time, and add abbreviations in brackets for subsequent use
* Do not use technical jargon or Oxford-speak (e.g. Hilary term) 



Capitalisation
--------------

When referring to the Division and the University, and implicitly meaning the Medical Sciences Division or University of Oxford, please capitalise Division and University. Do not capitalise in other instances

Correct use of capitalisation: 

* The Division is the largest division in the University.
* The University has four divisions. I work in the best division, the Medical Sciences Division. The Division is great!
* I work on the divisional website in the divisional office. 
* I work in the Medical Sciences Divisional Office, for the divisional Finance team.



Bullet points
-------------

* Donâ€™t punctuate at the end of each bullet point
* Capitalise each new bullet point
