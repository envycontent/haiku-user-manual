Track Visitors to your Site with Google Analytics 
======================================================================================================

You can track visitors to your website with Google Analytics. To do this set up a Google Analytics account at: *http://www.google.com/analytics/* and generate the analytics tracking code. Send this code to *haiku@medsci.ox.ac.uk* and it will be added to your site. 

You will need a Google account for your department to set up a Google Analytics account. You can either set up a Google email address (go to: *http://accounts.google.com/SignUp*) or use a University email address. You should use a general email address so that the account isn't tied to an individual's email address.

Help on Google Analytics is available from Google at: *http://support.google.com/analytics/*

We can also provide help and support - please email *haiku@medsci.ox.ac.uk*
