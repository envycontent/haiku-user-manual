Create a New Profile
======================================================================================================

This shows you how to create profiles for new members of staff. There are three different types of profiles: 
1. Full profiles give the member of staff an opportunity to include information about themselves, a photo, details of their publications etc.
2. Stub profiles appear in staff listings giving a name and job title. You can't add any further information.
3. External profiles give you a way of including team members from other institutions - you can link their profile to information about them on an external website.
