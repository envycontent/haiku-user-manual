Add Research Interests to a Profile (MSD Graduate School)
=========================================================

Research interests can be added to a profile. Research interests display on the profile, the list of all supervisors, on subject area pages and Doctoral Training Centre course pages. 

This shows you how to add research interests to a local profile created on the MSD Graduate School site. Research interests for remote profiles need to be added by the supervisor to their profile on their department site.
