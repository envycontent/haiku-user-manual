Create a New Profile
====================

.. note:: These user guides are being phased out and replaced with the guides on `Haiku Knowledge Base <https://fry-it.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HKB/Haiku+Knowledge+Base>`_


This shows you how to create profiles for new members of staff. You can create three different types of profiles: 

1. Full profiles give the member of staff an opportunity to include information about themselves, a photo, details of their publications etc.

2. Stub profiles appear in staff listings giving a name and job title. 

3. External profiles give you a way of including team members from other institutions - you can link their profile to information about them on an external website. 

You can also create remote profiles which allow you to include profiles on your site from other Haiku website. See the :doc:`Add a Remote Profile <add-a-remote-profile>` guide for details of how to do this.

To create a profile add the following details:

#. First name
#. Last name
#. The SSO username (for external profiles make up a username - external team members aren't able to edit anything on their profiles)
#. Email address
#. This is only for external profiles - if you would like the university logo of the external organisation to appear to the right of the person's name in the staff lists (in the same location as a profile image appears) select the university from the drop down list. If the university you need doesn't appear in the drop down list please contact us - haiku@medsci.ox.ac.uk
#. Select the profile type you would like from the drop down list - Full profile, Stub profile or External profile
#. This is only for external profiles - if your external team member has profile information on their home institution website enter the web address here
#. Highlight the category the profile should be assigned to - you can select more than one.
#. Click the top arrow to assign the categories selected in step 8 to the profile. 
#. Click Save.

Staff members with full profiles can now edit them. 

Publish profiles when they are ready to be seen by the public.
