Scroll down the page until you reach the **Categories** section. 
The box on the left lists categories which haven't been assigned to your event. The box on the right lists categories which have been assigned to your event. 

To assign a category to your event: 
1. Highlight the term that you would like to assign to your event.
2. Move the highlighted term to the right hand box by clicking on the top arrow.
3. Click on **Save**. 

(If the term that you would like to assign to your event is not available you will need to ask your editor-in-chief to add this for you.)
