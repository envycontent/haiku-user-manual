Add a News Item to the MSD website
==================================

This shows you how to add a news item to the news section - `https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/news <https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/news>`_

We add all news that relates to the Medical Sciences Division from the main University site - `http://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events <http://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events.>`_. To check whether a news item is from a department or unit in the Medical Sciences department look at the list on our website - `https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/departments <https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/departments.>`_. Other news items will be emailed to you.

We have two news sections on our site using different categories. The only categories which should be used in this section are: Athena Swan, Awards and Appointments, Blogs, Clinical Trials, Events, General, Innovation, Research and Staff. **Note:**  **Awards and Appointments** category - if news items have only been assigned this category they won't appear on the news feed on the homepage (`https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/) <https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/>`_.  

#. The items in the column on the left are categories which haven't been applied to the news item. To assign categories to a news item these need to be moved to the column on the right. Click the names of the categories you would like to assign to the news item. 
#. Click the top arrow to move the items to the column on the right assigning them to the news item. 
#. You can change the order of the categories by selecting the item and using the up and down arrows. 
#. Click **Save**.
