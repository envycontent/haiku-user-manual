Setting up an alias enables you to give a page an alternate web address. This can be used, for example, if you wish to have a simpler or shorter web address for publicity material or if you have moved the location of a page and would like set up the old web address as an additional address.

In this example we will give an Events page a shorter web address.	

Find your page and click on Aliases

   :align: center
   

Go to the page you would like to give an additional web address to and click on Aliases. 

This page currently has a web address of: **www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/seminars/conference-genetic-approaches-to-study-the-neurobiology-of-learning-and-memory**
In the next step we will give this an alias of: **www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/neurobiology**


Enter alternative web address

   :align: center
   

1. Enter the alternative web address. Don't include the first part of the web address (e.g. www.dpag.ox.ac.uk) - start with the first slash after ox.ac.uk . Don't have spaces in your web address - use hyphen instead.
2. Click on **Add**.
