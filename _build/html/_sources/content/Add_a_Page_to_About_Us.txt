How to put an additional page into the About Us section. This is straightforward, but you need to know that you're in the right place before adding the page.

# You'll see the title of the section
# plus a list of all the pages in that section (compare these to the links in the navigation in the first screenshot)
# if you **don't** see the pages, then use the up arrow to navigate up a level in the website tree


Add New

You can then start editing your page:


# Title - will appear as the page heading
# Short title - is optional, but can be used for a shorter or alternative title to appear in navigation listings (this is useful if the heading is very long)
# Description - this will be the first paragraph on the page
