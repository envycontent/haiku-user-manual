===============================

.. note:: These user guides are being phased out and replaced with the guides on `Haiku Knowledge Base <https://fry-it.atlassian.net/wiki/display/HKB/Haiku+Knowledge+Base>`_

When your profile is first created you have an editable area of text running down the middle of the page. If you would like to add text to other parts of your profile you need to add a Text Tile. This shows you how to do this.

You will now see a set of icons at the top of your Profile. Holding you mouse button down drag the icon to the part of your page where you would like to add the Text Tile (for example underneath your contact details).

When you drag the tile over an area of the page where you can add the tile a coloured box will appear. Let go of your mouse button to place the Text Tile in place of the coloured box.
